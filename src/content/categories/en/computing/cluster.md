**A cluster**, refers to a group of machines that work together that perform a similar function. a computer cluster is controlled by a single software program that manages all the computers (also called "nodes") within the cluster. The nodes work together to complete a single task. This process is called "parallel computing" since the nodes perform operations in tandem. Computer clusters can range from two machines to hundreds of connected computers. Small clusters are often used to improve the performance of web and online gaming services by handling multiple incoming requests in parallel.
