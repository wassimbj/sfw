A common example is a webpage that defers loading images until the user scrolls to their location within the page. Lazy loading videos is also popular on the web. It is especially effective since video files are typically the largest resources loaded within a webpage. Instead of sending the entire video to a client's device, the web server only sends small portions of the video while the user is watching it. Popular video sharing websites like YouTube and Vimeo use lazy loading.<br>\n</br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i2UfbjUx9E4OFGc6lqmH_qF3RwKw5yKu3VecpcdDM0znXUGFCSmHAx8IHcGi_NXOfCPVny7wmAmgXl1k5i3Nacm7gg4hbe22KFog8f4Yf-g1uJLb_pq6hSC0c_3qL_1EvWwf7ETQ\" alt=\"img\"></p>","fileAbsolutePath":"D:/wassim-workspace/opensource/sfwwebsite/src/content/categories/frontend/lazy-loading.md"}}]}}}
